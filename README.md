# FizzBuzz

```
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
```

Create the files you'll need to solve this problem in both JavaScript and Ruby.

If you solve it quickly, try to come up with as many alternate solutions as you can think of.
